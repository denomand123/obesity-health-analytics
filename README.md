# obesity-health-analytics

This project explores and analyzes global obesity data to uncover trends, identify key factors, and predict future obesity rates using machine learning techniques. The analysis was conducted using Python in Google Colab, with support from AutoML tools.

## üìä Project Objectives

- Understand the distribution and trends of obesity across countries.
- Identify potential correlations with health indicators.
- Predict future obesity rates using regression models.
- Visualize data insights to inform health-focused decision-making.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- Google AutoML
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning (Regression Models)
- API integration (for real-time health data)


## üîç Key Insights

- Countries with higher urbanization and income levels showed increased obesity rates.
- Childhood and adolescent obesity rates are rising rapidly.
- Feature importance analysis showed physical inactivity and unhealthy diet as top predictors.

## üìà Results

- The best-performing model predicted obesity with over 85% accuracy.
- Visual dashboards clearly show regional disparities in obesity prevalence.

## ü§ñ Future Work

- Integrate additional health indicators like physical activity levels and food consumption.
- Improve prediction accuracy with more complex models or ensemble techniques.
- Build a web dashboard for real-time obesity monitoring.
